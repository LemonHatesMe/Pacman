	The Java based project we were assigned to complete based on a modified game of the Pac-Man game, using a 2D simulation while implementing several strategies and algorithms included the paper we were given. The project was a comparison between a traditional BFS against more complicated algorithms such as A*. The overall goal the paper wanted to achieve is the make the success rate of the player decrease significantly as the algorithm became more complex. In this program, we used BFS which is mainly used to detect the shortest path in an unweighted structured environment such as graphs or mazes. This can be seen with the characters of Blinky, Clyde, and inky yo determine their next target tiles. On the other hand, Pinky used a more complicated algorithm called, A* Search which combines path cost with an estimated cost to the overall target, creating a both optimal and efficient pathfinding. The A* search allowed Pinky and parts of Inky's movements to cut off Pac-Man. 
	Overall, the project did not end there, it included a scared timer logic that turned the Ghosts into a panicked flee rather than the chase mode they previously had. We had to implement an algorithm that reduce the speed and movements capabilities of the Ghosts. Which follows the original logic of the well known game. This was accomplished by creating a loop that is triggered by Pac-Man's consumption of a Power Pellet and continue until the end of the timer breaks the loop.
	In order to have each of the specific Ghosts to move through the maze grid, it was vital to not only track the player's movement but as well as the pixel-to-tile direction of both the player and the Ghost to find the best optimal path for each ghost. This was important, especially when it came to implementing Pinky and Inky's algorithm to trap the player into a tight spot.
